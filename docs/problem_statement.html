    <h1>508 Compliant PDF Conversion Agent Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>
        The objective is to develop an AI-powered tool that ensures PDF files are compliant with Section 508 accessibility standards. This tool will accept a single PDF file as input and output a modified PDF file that adheres to these standards. The compliance requirements include, but are not limited to, WCAG 2.1 Level AA success criteria and PDF/UA (ISO 14289) requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tool should be operable from the command line and should leverage GPT-4o-mini for compliance processing. The GPT-4o-mini model will handle the majority of the compliance tasks. The tool should extract the text and structure from the PDF, send it to the GPT-4o-mini model for analysis and correction, and then produce a compliant PDF file based on the model's output.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key features of the tool include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Command-line interface to specify input and output file paths.</li>
        <li>Extraction of text and metadata from PDF files.</li>
        <li>Integration with GPT-4o-mini to analyze and correct compliance issues.</li>
        <li>Generation of a new PDF file with enhanced accessibility features based on GPT-4o-mini's recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The project must be completed in 4 weeks, following an iterative development process with 1-week sprints. The team consists of one product manager, one developer, and one tester.
