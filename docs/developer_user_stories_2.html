    <h1>508 Compliant PDF Conversion Agent Developer User Stories: Sprint 2</h1>

    <h2>Ticket: LIN-006 - Integrate RouteLLM</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Integrate RouteLLM into the existing system for routing requests between strong and weak models based on the size of PDF files.</p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>RouteLLM is set up and configured for the project.</li>
        <li>Requests are routed appropriately based on the PDF file size.</li>
        <li>Google's Gemini-Pro is used for large files, and OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini is used for smaller files.</li>
        <li>Integration is tested to ensure correct routing and response handling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ticket: LIN-007 - Implement Model Selection Logic</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Implement the logic within RouteLLM to determine which LLM model to use based on the size of the PDF file.</p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Model selection is based on predefined thresholds for file size.</li>
        <li>Ensure the system can dynamically select between Gemini-Pro and GPT-4o-mini.</li>
        <li>Test cases confirm that the correct model is selected for a range of file sizes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ticket: LIN-008 - Testing and Validation of RouteLLM Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Conduct thorough testing and validation of the RouteLLM integration, ensuring proper routing and accurate response generation.</p>
    <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Test with a variety of PDF file sizes to ensure proper routing and model selection.</li>
        <li>Verify that the outputs from both Gemini-Pro and GPT-4o-mini meet the system prompt requirements.</li>
        <li>Document any issues and ensure they are resolved before the end of the sprint.</li>
    </ul>
